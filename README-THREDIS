Thredis
-------

Thredis is threaded Redis. (Apparently "thredis" is also "ribbons" in
Scots). At this point it is work-in-progress ALPHA quality, probably
contains many bugs and in need of much improvement, but should be
sufficient as proof-of-concept to toy around with. Use at your own
risk.

Problem

If you're using Redis for complex operations (such as big ZUNION
operations), the server can block for a long time and only uses one
core. It would be nice if other operations could take place
concurrently, using many cores.

Solution

Certain commands (the ones that are obviously O(N) or more) are
submited to their own threads.

How / implications

Clearly this requires locking. The total number of locks required is
equal to the number of clients + one per every db + a global server
lock. Every operation requires checking the hash of locked keys, which
makes everything slower. Also, determinism is impossible with
concurrency, therefore you should NEVER use Thredis as a master - your
slaves will have a different database from the master.

Getting started

You probably want start out by trying the thredis-2.6 branch. It is
based on a stable Redis release.
